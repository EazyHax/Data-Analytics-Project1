## Features

This repository includes several features that highlight different analytical techniques:

- **Changes Over Time**: Analyze trends in data over specified time intervals.
- **Cumulative Analysis**: Calculate running totals and cumulative values for various metrics.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the performance of different business units or products.
- **Data Segmentation**: Segment data based on various criteria for targeted analysis.
- **Part-to-Whole Analysis**: Understand the contribution of individual components to the overall dataset.

## SQL Scripts

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the SQL scripts included in this repository:

1. **change_over_time.sql**: This script helps you analyze how key metrics change over a defined period.
   
2. **cumulative_analysis.sql**: Use this script to compute cumulative sums for specified fields.
   
3. **performance_metrics.sql**: This script evaluates the performance of different segments within your dataset.
   
4. **data_segmentation.sql**: Segment your data based on predefined criteria to gain deeper insights.
   
5. **part_to_whole_analysis.sql**: This script illustrates how individual components contribute to the overall data.

## Usage

To use the SQL scripts, follow these steps:

1. Open your SQL client (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio).
2. Load the desired SQL script.
3. Modify the script as needed to fit your database schema.
4. Execute the script to see the results.

Make sure to refer to the comments within each script for guidance on how to customize them.

## Technologies Used

This project primarily uses SQL for data analysis. The scripts are compatible with SQL Server, but you can adapt them for other SQL dialects with minor adjustments.
